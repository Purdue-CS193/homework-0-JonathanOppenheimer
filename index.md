# Jonathan Oppenheimer's First CS193 Homework 

### Some of my favorite things about CS193:
- The student TAs seem cool 
- The class looks like it's going to be fairly easy 
- There's only homework every 2 weeks or so
- It'll affect my GPA (unlike CS191) 
- It's in a much better lecture hall than any of my other lectures (we actually get little desks)
